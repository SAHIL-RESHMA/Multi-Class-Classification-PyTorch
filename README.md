# Multi-Class-Classification-PyTorch
Developed a multi-class classification model using a fully connected neural network in PyTorch. Applied CrossEntropy loss  for optimization, tuned hyperparameters to enhance generalization, and visualized decision boundaries to improve model  interpretability on structured datasets.
